      <h1>Climate Reporting Requirements in CSRD</h1>
      <img src={InsughtImageThird} />
      <p>
        The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European
        Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) guide financial institutions
        on how to approach climate-related disclosures. We explain the specific
        requirements under these frameworks, focusing on disclosure of climate
        risks.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSRD and ESRS have set a structured framework for climate-related
        disclosures, emphasizing transparency and uniformity across financial
        institutions within the EU. The primary goal is to provide stakeholders
        with comprehensive data on how climate-related risks are managed and to
        identify potential opportunities that climate change might present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accurate and reliable data collection remains a challenge for many
        institutions. The need for high-quality data that can support the
        required disclosures under CSRD and ESRS necessitates enhanced data
        management systems and processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial institutions must evaluate and disclose how climate-related
        risks impact their financials, covering aspects such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Physical Risks:</b> The potential monetary impacts of
          climate-induced physical risks on assets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transition Risks:</b> The financial implications of transitioning
          to a low-carbon economy, including changes in asset values and
          potential liabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Opportunities:</b> Potential benefits from transitioning to greener
          alternatives or technologies that might open new markets or improve
          competitive advantage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ESRSs specifically mandates the disclosure of climate-related risks,
        underlining the need for detailed, asset-specific data to evaluate both
        current and future risks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Granular Risk Identification:</b> Financial institutions should
          employ asset-level data to pinpoint the exact nature and location of
          both transitional and physical climate risks. This data-driven
          approach allows for a more precise identification of vulnerabilities
          across the institution's portfolio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Detailed Impact Analysis:</b> By leveraging detailed asset data,
          institutions can assess the specific impacts of identified risks on
          individual assets, aggregating this information to understand broader
          implications on business operations and strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Advanced Risk Management Strategies:</b> The utilization of
          asset-level data informs more targeted risk mitigation measures,
          enhancing the precision and effectiveness of management strategies
          tailored to specific asset vulnerabilities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The use of scenario analysis in assessing climate risks requires
        sophisticated modeling techniques and deep understanding of both
        climatology and the impact of extreme weather on specific assets.
        Financial institutions must develop or acquire the capability to conduct
        robust scenario analyses that meet regulatory expectations.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The CSRD and ESRS represent a transformative shift in how financial
        institutions in the EU will approach sustainability reporting, with a
        particular emphasis on the comprehensive and transparent reporting of
        climate risks. As these regulations come into force, institutions must
        enhance their systems, processes, and capabilities to meet these new
        standards. The focus on detailed and reliable climate risk reporting
        will not only comply with regulatory requirements but also provide
        significant value to stakeholders by highlighting the resilience and
        sustainability of financial institutions in the face of climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Financial institutions should begin by assessing their current reporting
        capabilities against the CSRD and ESRS requirements, identifying gaps,
        and developing implementation plans based on the phased timelines.
